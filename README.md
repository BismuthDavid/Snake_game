# Python Snake Game

This is a classic snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.
The game starts with a single cube snake controlled by the player, which grows as it consumes food items appearing randomly on the screen. 
The objective is to guide the snake to eat as much food as possible without colliding with its own body.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
- Random generation of food items.
- Game over when the snake collides with itself more than 3 times. 

## How to Play
1.	Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
2.	Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3.	Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
4.	Run `main.py` to start the game.
5.	Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
6.	Eat as much food as possible and avoid collisions to increase your score.
7.	The game ends when the snake collides with itself more than 3 times.

## Future Updates
I'll be periodically updating this game with new features and improvements. Some of the planned updates include:
-	Adding different game modes (e.g., time trial).
-	Implementing obstacles.
-	Count as a failure if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game screen.
-	Score tracking.
-	Levels of difficulties (speed and obstacles).
Stay tuned for more updates!
